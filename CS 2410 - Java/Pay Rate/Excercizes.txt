	a. 	-Find the sum of all of the scores in the list.
			Keep track of the number of elements.
		-Divide the total we just found by the number of elements.
			Be careful of integer division.
		-Report this result as the average test score.

	b.	-Create a loop to run through each student in the list.
		-Construct an if statement inside of the loop which compares
		 the scores of each student with the average score.
		-For each student where score < average, print out their info.

	c.	-Create a variable initialized below 0 to hold the maximum score.
		-Inside the loop we created before, compare each new value with
		 the value stored inside our variable. (Use an if statement.)
		-If the student's score is higher than the current value int the
		 variable, replace the value in the variable with the score.
		-Once the loop has terminated, report the value of the variable as
		 the highest score.

	d.	-Compare the maximum score found above with each individual
		 student's score in a manner similar part B. 
		-For each match found in the new loop, print out the student's
		 name instead of their score.
