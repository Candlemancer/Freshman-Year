								Slippery Maze
						A game made by Jonathan Petersen
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----Table of Contents----						// INFO: Slippery Maze was a
												//  game I coded for my Java
	1. Objective								//  class my Freshman Year of
	2. Controls									//	university. All in all,
	3. Features									//  it took me about twelve 
	4. Thanks									//  hours to code, though a 
												//  large part of that was on
-------------------------						//	features I never finished.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

								   OBJECTIVE

   The objective of Slippery Maze is simple. Get your hero, aptly named 
   "Hero" to the end of the level, conveniently labeled "Exit". Who our
   hero is or why they must reach the fabled "Exit" is a tale wrapped in
   mystery, like much in the world of Slippery Maze.

   // INFO: I really liked old video game manuals that gave you all sorts of
   //  wonky information, like the year the Galactic Federation was formed,
   //  or why, exactly, your hero hadn't wandered into that forest out back
   //  before now. Maybe that's the reason for so many adolescent heroes?

								   CONTROLS
								   				________________________
	There are two ways to control your 		|	|		|		|		|
	brave hero, keyboard style and mouse	|	|	^	|  Simply click |
	style. Simply click on any square to 	|	|_______|_______|_______|
	move your hero in that direction, or 	|	|		|		|		|
	use the arrow keys for a more hands- 	|	| Hero	|	> 	|	X	|
	on approach. Do note that the maze 		|	|_______|_______|_______|
	is slippery, though, and you won't 		|	|		|		|		|
	stop moving until you run into an 		|	|  \/	| Or use Arrows	|
	obstacle or hit the edge of the maze.	|	|_______|_______|_______|

								   FEATURES

   Don't worry, though. That's not all you'll get with a Slippery Maze game!
   In an effort to improve the memory of our young fellows, the world of 
   Slippery Maze has a new feature, -DARKNESS- which will obscure your field
   of vision to only what is immediately around your hero. This means you'll
   have to painstakingly remember each level (Or break out the old pen and 
   paper) in order to find the exit!

   // INFO: Originally, my advanced feature was going to be randomized level
   //  generation, and you can still find the code in the comments, but I 
   //  could never get my recursive pathfinding/maze generation algorithms to
   //  make anything that was fun to play. This feature, while not that hard
   //  technically, makes a better game in my opinion.
