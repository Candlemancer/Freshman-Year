4.	Private members of a class can only be accessed from within that class, 
	while protected members can be accessed only within that class or within its subclasses.

5.	A method is overloaded if it has multiple definitions with different parameter lists, 
	and overridden if its definition changes when the object is subclassed. 

6.	One situation where you would use the keyword "super" is while writing constructors of a
	subclass, in order to invoke the constructor of the superclass. Another situation would
	be if you wanted to specify that you were calling a method from a superclass, and not 
	calling the overridden method from the subclass.

12.	"2 This is Superclass"
	"Subclass: 7"
	"10 DDDDDD"

13.	The operator "instanceof" returns true if the provided reference variable points to an
	object of the specified type. (e.g. "intptr instanceof Integer" returns true if intptr 
	points to an object of the Integer type.)
